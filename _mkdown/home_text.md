This project intends to build a novel data management and analytics framework, focusing on three pillars: (1) data integration and federated learning, (2) explainable machine learning, and (3) legal and ethical integrity of predictive models. 

The project is a collaborative effort between four research institutions: the Department of Computer and Systems Sciences at Stockholm University, the Department of Law at Stockholm University, RISE Research Institute Sweden, and KTH.
